# Advent Of Code 2023
# ==================

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small coding puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
It's a tradition that [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) began in 2015, after he created [a](http://adventofcode.com/2015). You can [read up about page](http://adventofcode.com/about) for more information.
It's a great way to learn a new language or practice your programming skills. It's also a great way to have some fun with friends or co-workers!

## How do I participate?
Go to the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) website and sign up. You'll get a unique input file that you can use to solve the puzzles.

## Why this repository?
I'm using this repository to keep track of my solutions and to share them.
